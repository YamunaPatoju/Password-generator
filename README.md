# Password-generator
PASSWORD GENERATOR

This Python program generates a random, customizable password with a mix of letters, symbols, and numbers. You can control the length and composition of the password based on your preferences.

How the Game Works:
1.Input Parameters: The program asks you to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
2.Password Composition: It randomly selects characters from predefined sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
3.Shuffling: After selecting the required characters, the program shuffles them to ensure that the generated password is not predictable.
4.Final Password: The final password is then displayed for you to use.

FEATURES:
-Random Letters: Generates uppercase and lowercase letters.
-Customizable Symbols: Choose how many special characters you want.
-Customizable Numbers: Choose how many digits you want.
-Shuffling: The generated characters are shuffled to ensure randomness.
